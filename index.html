            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Jamal Kainbayov and I study software development at Techniek College Rotterdam. One of the projects I'm working on is making a portfolio site using SCSS. In this site I will tell you all about me and how I chose to be a software developer and what I have reached in these past years.</p>

            <p>Elementary school was completed</p>
            <p>After that I went to Mavo/Havo and in the 2nd year of high school I got Havo</p>
            <p>I reached Havo 4 and that's where I've decided to go to MBO 4 to actually start learning my passion. In this case, Software Development</p>

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>My first job ever was at McDonald's</p>
            <p>After 4 years at McDonald's, I started to work in a garage where I delivered car parts to a lot of different garages that needed them</p>
            <p>I worked there for like 5 months. After that, I decided to join Thuisbezorgd. I like the part where I can just deliver things without a manager above my head and where I can freely do stuff.</p>
            <p>Of course, I also had an internship where I gained some knowledge on coding and scraping. I had my internship at a company named Treehouse. I worked there for like 6 months. What they do is scraping homes and putting them on their site. I was a scraper and also worked a bit on the scraper itself.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I enjoy a lot of stuff. I like: coding, gaming, travelling, listening to music and I also like eating. I'm a real foodie when it comes to different cuisines. I also like to explore a lot of the world and its culture. There is a whole adventure waiting for me in the future. Also, if I just chill at home, I listen to music and do some coding. Eventually after coding, I like to play games with friends.</p>
